This app, developed in MATLAB, gets size of some matrices first; then user initialize the 'd' (difference between each pair of elements in a matrice) and matrices; afterwards this program calculates difference between each pair of matrix elements; so that if this difference is less than 'd' ; they're going to belong to a same class; the app should find the most optimized value for 'd' and number of matrices; such that, number of classes are not so many that differences among classes would be invisible, or too few that so much different elements would belong to a same class.
