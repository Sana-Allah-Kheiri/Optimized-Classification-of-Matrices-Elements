# Optimized-Classification-of-Matrices-Elements
This app, developed in MATLAB, gets size of some matrices first; then user initialize the d (difference between each pair of elements in a matrice) and matrices; afterwards this program calculates difference between each pair of matrix elements; so that if this difference is less than d ; they're going to belong to a same class;
